# OhCrab! ðŸ¦€

`ohcrab` is a port of the well known CLI tool
[`thefuck`](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) to our beloved Rust language.

## Installation

You can install `ohcrab` using one of the methods below. The recommended way is using the installer script.

### Installer Script (macOS & Linux)

You can install `ohcrab` by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luizvbo/oh-crab/main/install.sh)"
```

The script will automatically detect your operating system and architecture, download the latest binary, and install it to a local directory.

### Using Cargo

If you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can build and install `ohcrab` from source:

```shell
cargo install ohcrab
```

### Adding ohcrab to your environment

After installation, you need to add the `ohcrab` alias to your shell's configuration file. We currently support `bash` and `zsh`.

Run the appropriate command for your shell:

- For **bash**:

  ```shell
  eval $(ohcrab --shell bash)
  ```

- For **zsh**:
  ```shell
  eval $(ohcrab --shell zsh)
  ```

To make the alias available in all your terminal sessions, add the `eval` command to your `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or other startup script.

### Changing the alias

The default alias is `crab`. You can change it by using the `--alias` flag when generating the shell function. For example, to use `shinycrab` in `zsh`, run:

```shell
eval $(ohcrab --shell zsh --alias shinycrab)
```

## Usage

In the terminal, after typing the wrong command, type `crab` (or the alias you chose). It will show a menu to choose the correct command from.

## Contributing

If you like `ohcrab` and/or want to learn `rust`, you can contribute by adding
new rules or improving the crate.

## Road map

      function is generated.
- [ ] Add support to user shell aliases.
- [ ] Add support to PowerShell
- [ ] Reduce number/size of dependencies
